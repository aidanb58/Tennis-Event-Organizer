# Tennis-Event-Organizer

Python script designed to organize matchplay events at a tennis club. The script can take between 8 and 12 players. The code is object-oriented and each player is an object with 6 attributes:
name, skill, partner, singles (if player is willing to play singles), previous partners, and previous oppenents. The program is scalable and intended to store all members of a tennis club for easy adding to events. The comments in the code explain how to add players to the script.

The user of the program will enter all the players playing and the script organizes them into 3 rounds of matchplay. The user can enter a player stored in the program by entering their name. If the player is not stored as a member, the user can enter "new" and will be prompted to enter the details for a new player to be temporarily added. The user will enter "stop" when they have entered all the players. The script makes sure that no 2 players who aren't partners will play with each other more than once and no player will have to play the same opponents more than once. The script also makes sure that players who want to play with each other will be partnered together the whole time and that only players willing to play singles will be rotated into the singles matches. For each round, the script will find and display the most competitive/similar in skill matches that meet the previously mentioned criteria. This is calculated using each player's skill attribute and ensures the matches played are fair and fun. 

Note: The class contains a list of players that are pros/coaches. If there is an uneven number of players and a coach is entered as a player, the program will prioritize placing the coaches into the singles matches or have a coach play 1 v 2 if the numbers require it. This ensures that most players will be able to play doubles.
